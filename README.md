# Project Setup and Understanding npm Concepts

## Initializing a Node.js Project

### `npm init`

The `npm init` command is used to initialize a new Node.js project by creating a `package.json` file. This file serves as the project's metadata, including details like name, version, description, entry point, scripts, dependencies, and more.

Running `npm init` will prompt you to provide details manually. If you want to initialize with default values, use:

```sh
npm init -y
```

This automatically generates a `package.json` file with default settings.

## Understanding `package.json`

The `package.json` file is the core configuration file in a Node.js project. It includes:

- **Name**: Project name
- **Version**: Current version of the project
- **Description**: Short description of the project
- **Main**: Entry point file (e.g., `index.js or App.js`)
- **Scripts**: Custom commands to run scripts (e.g., `npm start`)
- **Dependencies**: List of required packages
- **DevDependencies**: Packages needed only for development

### Tilde (~) and Caret (^) Signs in `package.json`

- **Tilde (~)**: Allows patch updates only (e.g., `~1.2.3` allows updates to `1.2.x`, but not `1.3.0`)
- **Caret (^)**: Allows minor updates (e.g., `^1.2.3` allows updates up to `1.x.x`, but not `2.0.0`)

## Installing and Configuring Parcel

### `npm i -D parcel`

Parcel is a fast, zero-config bundler used for JavaScript applications. The `-D` flag (short for `--save-dev`) installs Parcel as a development dependency.

```sh
npm i -D parcel
```

This means Parcel is only required during development and will not be included in the production build.

## Understanding `package-lock.json`

### Importance of `package-lock.json`

- Ensures that all developers working on the project use the same package versions.
- Records the exact version of installed dependencies.
- Helps maintain consistency across different environments.
- Improves security by preventing accidental upgrades to incompatible versions.

## Node Modules

The `node_modules` folder contains all installed dependencies. This directory should not be modified manually, as it is managed by npm.

**Important:**

- `node_modules` can grow large, so it is generally excluded from version control (via `.gitignore`).
- To regenerate `node_modules`, simply run `npm install` using the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

## Running the Project with Parcel

### `npx parcel index.html`

The `npx` command runs binaries from `node_modules` without globally installing them. To start the development server:

```sh
npx parcel index.html
```

Parcel will:

- Automatically detect dependencies.
- Start a local server for development.
- Enable hot module replacement (HMR).
- Optimize assets for production when built.

## Injecting React in a Node.js Project

### CDN vs. npm Installation

Injecting React via CDN links (such as `<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>`) is **not recommended** for production applications. Reasons:

- **Performance**: Not optimized for modular JavaScript applications.
- **Scalability**: Harder to manage dependencies across a project.
- **Security**: Less control over package integrity.

### Installing React via npm

To properly install React within a Node.js environment, run:

```sh
npm i react
npm i react-dom
```

This installs React (`react`) and React's DOM package (`react-dom`) into the `node_modules` directory. This approach ensures:

- Better module bundling (e.g., with Webpack, Parcel, Vite, etc.).
- Full support for JSX and component-based architecture.
- Optimized builds for production.

## Configuring ES6 Modules

To use ES6 modules in your project, update your HTML script tags to include `type="module"`:

```html
<script type="module" src="./index.js"></script>
```

This informs the browser to treat the script as a module, enabling the use of `import` and `export` statements. [Learn more about ES6 modules.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

### Common Error When ES6 Modules Are Not Configured

![ES6 Module Error](assets/images/error_screenshot.png)

If you do not add `type="module"` to your script tag, you may encounter an error similar to the one below:

```
@parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.
```

This happens because modern JavaScript modules require explicit declaration. The error typically occurs when you import React or any other module in your JavaScript file but do not define the script as a module in your HTML file.

To fix this, ensure that your script tag in `index.html` looks like this:

```html
<script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>
```

## Parcel Features

Parcel offers a range of features to enhance development and production workflows:

- **Development Build**: Quickly compiles code for development purposes.
- **Local Server**: Starts a local server for testing and development.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Automatically updates modules in the browser without a full reload.
- **File Watching Algorithm**: Monitors files for changes to trigger automatic rebuilds.
- **Caching**: Speeds up builds by caching unchanged files.
- **Bundling**: Combines multiple files into optimized bundles.
- **Image Optimization**: Compresses images for faster load times.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Generates consistent filenames for caching purposes.
- **Code Splitting**: Breaks code into smaller chunks for improved load times.
- **Differential Bundling**: Creates bundles optimized for different environments (e.g., modern vs. legacy browsers).
- **Error Handling and Diagnostics**: Provides clear error messages and debugging information.
- **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused code to reduce bundle size.
- **Minification**: Compresses code to minimize file sizes.
- **Production Builds**: Generates optimized bundles for deployment.

    ### Configuring Package.json for Easier Commands

Instead of running `npx parcel index.html` for development and `npx parcel build index.html` for production every time, we can configure our `package.json` file to simplify this process:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
}
```

Now, you can start the development server with:

```sh
npm run start
```

And create a production build with:

```sh
npm run build
```

This makes running Parcel much more efficient and avoids repetitive commands.
